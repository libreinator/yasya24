I think it finally works in IE now!
The scroll animation now works in IE - I had to avoid calc and also vh units.
The :before and :after letters are hidden in IE - the "visible" of the pseudo-elements is not overriding the hidden of the parent like it should - I had to rely on color instead of visibility to hide some letters.
